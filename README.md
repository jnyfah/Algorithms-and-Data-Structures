# Data-Structures

Data structure is logical or mathematical organization of data; it describes how to store the data and access data from memory. There are two different types of data structure:   Linear Data Structure(sequential)e.g linked list and stacks     Non Linear Data Structure e.g trees and graphs

Linked List
        
        Stores data with nodes that point to other nodes.

Time Complexity:

    Indexing: Linked Lists: O(n)
    Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
    Optimized Search: Linked Lists: O(n)
    Insertion: Linked Lists: O(1)

Hash Table or Hash Map

    Stores data with key value pairs.
    Hash functions accept a key and return an output unique only to that specific key.
        
        Hash functions return a unique address in memory for that data.

    Hash collisions are when a hash function returns the same output for two distinct inputs. This can be solved by using the seperate chaining or addressing meethod
        
Time Complexity:

    Indexing: Hash Tables: O(1)
    Search: Hash Tables: O(1)
    Insertion: Hash Tables: O(1)

Binary Tree
    
    Is a tree like data structure where every node has at most two children.
        There is one left and right child node.

Time Complexity:

    Indexing: Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
    Search: Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
    Insertion: Binary Search Tree: O(log n)
